In this project, you will query the Parch and Posey Database. The Parch and Posey Database holds information about a paper store. For this project, you will be assisting the Parch and Posey team with understanding their web traffic, their customers and employees, and their order information.

You need to come up with 4 questions that you can answer with SQL. The questions must be complex enough to where the SQL used to answer it requires at least one JOIN and one Aggregation.

### Your presentation should include:
* Four slides
* One visualization per slide (You can export your query results from DB Browser to a csv and use Excel or any other spreadsheet software to create an appropriate chart)
* A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide

### Queries
Please include a text file that includes each of the queries used to create the visualizations. You should format your queries for readability,In a plain text file (use notepad, notepad++, or atom).

### Chinook Database
### Introduction
In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.


All of the below instructions are discussed in detail as you work through this lesson on your way to completing this project. The below serves as a quick reference of what you will be doing as you progress through the completion of this project.

### Instructions
You will need to follow the instructions on the next three concepts to get the Chinook database up and running on your own machine and check that it is set up correctly. There will be two parts to this project.
* The first part is a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. Though these questions will not be "graded" by a reviewer, they will help you self-assess.
* The second part is a presentation. Similar to the first project, there isn't a 'right answer' for the second portion of the project. You have the ability to be creative in the questions you ask. You will then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to answer your question successfully. Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question. The essentials of your project submission are discussed in the next sections. To review your presentation, you will need to save your slides as a **PDF**.
